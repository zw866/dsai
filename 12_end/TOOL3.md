## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Deployment Required**: App must remain deployed and accessible online. Local-only apps will not receive credit.
- **Presentation Required**: You must present your application in a live product demonstration session. **Attendance is Mandatory.** Distance Learning students may submit a video instead.
- **Production-Ready Focus**: This is about making your app production-ready, not adding new features. Focus on refinement, polish, and validation.
- **Quality Control**: You must show evidence that your AI prompting works. Implement quality control measures and demonstrate their effectiveness.
- **Stakeholder Value**: Clearly demonstrate how your app provides value to specific stakeholders.
- **If Private Data**: If using private data, you are encouraged to add a basic password authorization screen and provide the password in your submission. (Ask Cursor for help.)
