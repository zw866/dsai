## Develop a Meaningful API Query

🕒 *Estimated Time: 25 minutes*

---

## ✅ Your Task

Create an API query that returns substantial data (more than 1 row) useful for building a reporter application.

### 🧱 Stage 1: Design Query

- [ ] Review API documentation for endpoints that return multiple records
  -  Consider what data would be useful for analysis or reporting:
      - Time series data (e.g., daily weather, hourly transit arrivals)
      - Geographic data (e.g., multiple locations, regions, or areas)
      - Categorical data (e.g., multiple items, products, or entities)
      - Filtered datasets (e.g., specific date ranges, categories, or criteria)
- [ ] Design query returning **at least 10-20 rows** (time series, geographic, categorical, or filtered data)
- [ ] Plan required parameters, filters, or query options

### 🧱 Stage 2: Implement Query

- [ ] Create script (e.g., `my_good_query.py` or `my_good_query.R`)
- [ ] Load API key from `.env` file
- [ ] Write code with appropriate parameters and error handling
- [ ] Run and verify it returns expected data

### 🧱 Stage 3: Document Results

- [ ] Add comments explaining: API name, endpoint, parameters, expected data
- [ ] Document: number of records, key fields, data structure
