# README Formatting Standards

When creating or updating README.md files, follow these style and formatting requirements:

## Structure Requirements

- **Maximum length**: 1000 words
- **Table of Contents**: Always include a clickable TOC with anchor links to all major sections
- **Section headers**: Use clear, hierarchical headers (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
- **Bullet points**: Use bullet points frequently for lists, features, and key information
- **Code chunks**: Include brief, helpful code examples where relevant (keep concise)
- **Mermaid diagrams**: Include 1-2 mermaid diagrams to illustrate architecture, data flow, or workflows
- **Hyperlinks**: Link to relevant files, documentation, and external resources using markdown links

## Formatting Style

- **Clean formatting**: Use consistent spacing, proper markdown syntax
- **Developer-focused**: Write for developers, assume technical knowledge
- **Scannable**: Use bullet points, short paragraphs, clear section breaks
- **Actionable**: Include quick start guides, usage examples, and clear instructions

## Required Sections

At minimum, include:
- Overview/Introduction
- Quick Start
- Architecture/Components (with diagram)
- Usage Guide
- Project Structure
- Links to detailed documentation

## Example Structure

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description.

## Table of Contents

- [Quick Start](#quick-start)
- [Architecture](#architecture)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Documentation](#documentation)

## Quick Start

**Run:**
```bash
command here
```

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Component] --> B[Component]
```

## Usage

- Feature 1: Description
- Feature 2: Description

## Documentation

See [`docs/`](docs/) for detailed information.
```

## Code Examples

- Keep code blocks brief and focused
- Include file paths in links: `[app.R](app.R)`
- Use appropriate language tags for syntax highlighting
- Show both command-line and code examples when relevant

## Diagrams

- Use mermaid for architecture, data flow, or sequence diagrams
- Keep diagrams simple and focused
- Maximum 2 diagrams per README
- Place diagrams in relevant sections (not all at the top)
