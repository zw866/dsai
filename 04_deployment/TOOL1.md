# 📌 TOOL

## App V1: Deployed AI-Powered Data Analytics Application

🕒 *Estimated Time: 4-6 hours*

---

## 📋 Tool Overview

Build and deploy a working **AI-powered data analytics application** as a team. Your app must query an API, use AI to generate insights, and display results in a deployed ShinyApp. **You are expected and encouraged to use Cursor to support your coding.**

This tool compiles work from:
- [`LAB_your_good_api_query.md`](../01_query_api/LAB_your_good_api_query.md) - API queries
- [`LAB_cursor_shiny_app.md`](../02_productivity/LAB_cursor_shiny_app.md) - Shiny application
- [`LAB_ai_reporter.md`](../03_query_ai/LAB_ai_reporter.md) - AI-powered reporting
- Deployment activities from Module 4

**Note**: This is a **group assignment**. Team members can choose different APIs for their individual homeworks, but the team must agree on one API for the deployed app. All team members must be able to access the chosen API.

---

## 📝 Instructions

### Who?
Group assignment - 1 app per team.

### What?
Build and deploy a **ShinyApp dashboard** that queries an API, uses AI to generate insights, and displays results with key stats and visuals. Your app must be **deployed** and accessible online. **Submit a single .docx file.**

### Why?
This tool demonstrates your ability to integrate API queries, web applications, and AI capabilities into a working, deployed software tool.

## ✅ Your Task

Your deployed ShinyApp must include:

- [ ] **API Integration**: Queries a public API and retrieves meaningful data
- [ ] **Key Statistics**: Displays important summary statistics from your data
- [ ] **AI-Powered Insights**: Uses AI (Ollama or OpenAI) to generate summaries or insights from the data. You probably won't need
- [ ] **User Interface**: Clean, readable interface with appropriate colors and layout
    - [ ] **Reactive Text**: Text that updates based on user inputs
    - [ ] **Value Boxes**: Displays key metrics in value boxes
    - [ ] **Visualizations**: Includes at least 2-3 reactive visualizations
- [ ] **Deployment**: App is deployed and accessible online (DigitalOcean, Posit Cloud Connect, or Posit Connect)
- [ ] **Password Protection** (if needed): If your app uses private data, add password authorization and provide the password to the instructor

## 📤 To Submit

Your submission should include:

- [ ] **🔗 [25 pts] Deployed App Link**: Working link to your deployed app (GitHub, Posit Cloud Connect, or DigitalOcean). The link **must work** and be accessible.
- [ ] **📊 [50 pts] Functional App**: The app must run a meaningful analysis of API data using thoughtful, well designed AI queries. (This means you probably need to use a cloud AI provider for your queries, eg. OpenAI or Ollama Cloud. Contact me if your company expressly forbids that.)
- [ ] **📝 [25 pts] App Description**: Written description of your app (NOT AI-generated)
  - **📝 [10 pts] Description**: What your app does, what API it uses, and what insights it provides. Written in your own words (3-5 paragraphs)
  - **🛠️ [10 pts] Process Diagram**: Visual diagram showing data flow from API → processing → visualization → AI insights (hand-drawn or digital)
  - [ ] **👥 [5 pts] Team Members by Role**: List of team members and their roles. (Note: *everyone* is a developer here.) Suggested developer roles include:
    - 🧪 Project Manager: System architecture, system integration, performance testing, deployment
    - 🔌 Backend Developer: API integration, data processing, and data pipeline
    - 🎨 Frontend Developer: UI/UX design, reactive components, and visual design
    - 🤖 Prompt Engineer: AI integration, prompt engineering, and AI-powered insights
    - 📊 Data Engineer: Statistical analysis, data transformations, and visualizations
    - 🚀 DevOps Engineer: Deployment, testing, and performance optimization
    - 📊 Full Stack Developer: Integration across components, reactive text, and value boxes
    - 🧪 QA Engineer: Quality assurance, testing, and validation

**Total: 100 pts**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Deployment Required**: App must be deployed and accessible online. Local-only apps will not receive credit.
- **If Private Data**: If using private data, you are encouraged to add a basic password authorization screen and provide the password in your submission. (Ask Cursor for help.)
- **AI Warning**: You can use AI - so I expect that the app will be good! :)
