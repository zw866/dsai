# Start by creating a list object for `input` and `output`
# then fill them with test input and test output data.

# test input data
input = list(n = 30, type = "chihuahua")

# test output data
output = list(mydogs = NULL)

# your function

}

# perform the operation
output$mydogs = count_my_dogs(n = input$n, type = input$type)

# Check your output object
