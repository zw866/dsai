## Homework 2: AI Agent System with RAG and Tools

🕒 *Estimated Time: 3-4 hours*

---

## 📋 Homework Overview

Compile your work from the last 3 weeks into a complete **AI agent system** that combines multi-agent orchestration, RAG, and function calling.

This homework compiles work from:
- [`LAB_prompt_design.md`](../06_agents/LAB_prompt_design.md) - Multi-agent prompt design
- [`LAB_custom_rag_query.md`](../07_rag/LAB_custom_rag_query.md) - RAG queries
- [`LAB_multi_agent_with_tools.md`](LAB_multi_agent_with_tools.md) - Multi-agent systems with tools

**Note**: This homework compiles work from 3 weekly LABS. Each LAB represents the next step of your project. Show us your individual progress by compiling your work into a complete AI agent system.

## ✅ Your Deliverable

### AI Agent System with RAG and Tools [100 pts]

Your deliverable should be a complete system that demonstrates:
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: A workflow with 2-3 agents working together (from LAB 1)
- **RAG Integration**: Context-aware responses using retrieval from your data source (from LAB 2)
- **Function Calling**: Agents that use tools to interact with external APIs or data sources (from LAB 3)

**Requirements:**

- [ ] **📝 [25 pts] Writing Component**: Brief written explanation of your system (NOT AI-generated)
  - Explain what your system does
  - Describe how the components work together
  - Discuss any design choices or challenges you encountered
  - Written in your own words (3+ paragraphs)

- [ ] **🔗 [25 pts] Code, as Git Repository Links**: Working, valid links to relevant content in your git repository
  - Link to your multi-agent orchestration script
  - Link to your RAG implementation
  - Link to your function calling/tool definitions
  - Link to your main system file (if different)
  - Links must be functional and point to the correct files

- [ ] **📸 [25 pts] Screenshots/Outputs**: Screenshots and/or samples of outputs
  - Screenshot showing your multi-agent workflow in action
  - Screenshot demonstrating RAG retrieval and response
  - Screenshot showing function calling/tool usage
  - At least 3-4 screenshots total

- [ ] **📚 [25 pts] Documentation**: Brief documentation for your system
  - **System Architecture**: Description of your agent roles and workflow
  - **RAG Data Source**: Description of your data source and search function
  - **Tool Functions**: Table or list describing each tool: name, purpose, parameters, and what it returns
  - **Technical Details**: Any information needed to understand your software (e.g., API keys, endpoints, packages, file structure)
  - **Usage Instructions**: How to install dependencies, set up data sources, configure API keys, and run the system. Make it easy for me!

**Total: 100 pts**
