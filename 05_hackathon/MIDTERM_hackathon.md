# 📌 MIDTERM

## AI Systems Hackathon

🕒 *Estimated Time: 24 hours*

---

## 📋 Lab Overview

Build and deploy a new **AI-powered system** in response to one of three prompts during a 24-hour hackathon event. Your team will design, implement, and demo a functional tool that incorporates generative AI and meets a specific stakeholder need.

**Challenge**: Can you build something functional and demo-ready in 24 hours? Can you make AI do something interesting that solves a real problem?

**Timeline**: 
- **Event**: March 6-7, 2026
- **Start**: Friday, March 6 at 3:30 PM
- **End**: Saturday, March 7 at 3:30 PM
- **Demo Session**: Saturday, March 7, 2:30-3:30 PM

**Team Size**: Teams of 3-5 students (on-campus only)

## ✅ Your Tasks

### Task 1: Choose Your Prompt

- [ ] Attend kickoff meeting (Friday 3:30 PM)
- [ ] Review the 3 available prompts
- [ ] Select one prompt that your team will solve
- [ ] Confirm your team's prompt choice by 4:00 PM Friday

### Task 2: Design Your System

- [ ] Design an AI-powered tool that responds to your chosen prompt
- [ ] Define your stakeholder and use case
- [ ] Plan how you'll integrate **generative AI** (OpenAI or Ollama Cloud)
- [ ] Decide on your deployment platform (REST API, Shiny App, or other deployable app)

### Task 3: Build Your Tool

- [ ] Build a functional, working prototype
- [ ] Integrate generative AI to provide meaningful functionality
- [ ] Create 2-3 test datasets to demonstrate your tool
- [ ] Deploy your tool (e.g., Posit Connect, DigitalOcean, or public API)

### Task 4: Demo and Submit

- [ ] Push all code to a **public GitHub repository** by 2:00 PM Saturday
- [ ] Prepare documentation (README, codebook, usage instructions)
- [ ] Demo your tool during the demo session (2:30-3:30 PM Saturday)

## 💡 Tips and Resources

- **Optional trainings**: Attend optional training sessions on querying AI, building APIs, using Cursor IDE, Supabase, and deploying to Posit Connect
- **Mentor hours**: Take advantage of mentor check-ins on Friday evening and Saturday morning
- **Use Cursor**: AI-assisted coding with Cursor is encouraged
- **Scope wisely**: A small system that works is better than a large one that doesn't
- **Team coordination**: Divide responsibilities and stagger breaks to keep momentum
- **Focus on working**: The goal is a functional, deployed tool that demonstrates AI integration
