## Manual Text Quality Control

🕒 *Estimated Time: 10-15 minutes*

## ✅ Your Task

Learn to manually perform quality control on AI-generated text by counting concepts, detecting patterns, and creating quality control metrics using `stringr` and `dplyr`.

### 🧱 Stage 1: Load and Analyze Sample Text

- [ ] Open [`01_manual_quality_control.R`](01_manual_quality_control.R) in your IDE
- [ ] Review the script structure and comments to understand the quality control approach
- [ ] Run the script to load the sample report text from [`data/sample_reports.txt`](data/sample_reports.txt)
- [ ] Observe the concept counts, quality control checks, and text metrics that are calculated

### 🧱 Stage 2: Create Quality Control Metrics Table

- [ ] Examine the quality control results table that combines all metrics
- [ ] Review how `stringr` functions are used to:
  - Count concept occurrences (`str_count()`)
  - Detect patterns (`str_detect()`)
  - Extract numbers and percentages
- [ ] Review how `dplyr` is used to create summary tables
- [ ] Run the script and view the comprehensive quality control results

## 📤 To Submit

- For credit: Submit a screenshot showing the quality control results table (the "Comprehensive Quality Control Results" output) from running [`01_manual_quality_control.R`](01_manual_quality_control.R).
