## Agent Rules

🕒 *Estimated Time: 10-15 minutes*

---

## ✅ Your Task

Use YAML rules to structure and guide agent behavior. Modify rules to see how they affect agent outputs.

### 🧱 Stage 1: Load and Understand Rules

- [ ] Open [`04_rules.yaml`](04_rules.yaml) and review the rule structure
- [ ] Note how rules are organized by agent type (data_analysis, press_release)
- [ ] Open [`04_rules.R`](04_rules.R) or [`04_rules.py`](04_rules.py) and see how rules are loaded and formatted
- [ ] Run the script to see how rules are incorporated into agent prompts

### 🧱 Stage 2: Modify Rules

- [ ] Edit [`04_rules.yaml`](04_rules.yaml) to change one rule (e.g., modify output format requirements or tone)
- [ ] Run [`04_rules.R`](04_rules.R) or [`04_rules.py`](04_rules.py) again
- [ ] Compare the agent's output before and after the rule change
- [ ] Try modifying a different rule to see its impact

## 📤 To Submit

- For credit: Submit a screenshot showing your modified rule in the YAML file and the agent's output reflecting that change.
