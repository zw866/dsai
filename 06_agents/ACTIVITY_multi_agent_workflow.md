## Multi-Agent Workflows

🕒 *Estimated Time: 10-15 minutes*

## ✅ Your Task

Build a simple multi-agent workflow where agents work together in sequence. Understand how to chain agents together.

### 🧱 Stage 1: Understand the Workflow

- [ ] Open [`03_agents.R`](03_agents.R) or [`03_agents.py`](03_agents.py) and review the workflow
- [ ] Identify the three stages: data fetching, analysis agent, and press release agent
- [ ] Note how each agent's output becomes the next agent's input
- [ ] Review [`functions.R`](functions.R) or [`functions.py`](functions.py) to understand the `agent_run()` helper function

### 🧱 Stage 2: Create a Simple 2-Agent Chain

- [ ] Create a new script or modify the example to build a 2-agent workflow
- [ ] Design Agent 1: Takes raw data and produces a summary
- [ ] Design Agent 2: Takes the summary and produces formatted output
- [ ] Run your workflow and verify agents pass information correctly
