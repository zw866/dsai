## ✅ Your Task

Learn how system prompts define agent behavior and roles. Modify system prompts to change how an AI agent responds.

### 🧱 Stage 1: Understand System Prompts

- [ ] Open [`02_using_ollamar.R`](02_using_ollamar.R) or [`02_using_ollama.py`](02_using_ollama.py) and review the system prompt
- [ ] Note how the system prompt defines the agent's role: "You are a talking mouse. Your name is Jerry. You can only talk about mice and cheese."
- [ ] Run the script to see how the agent responds with this system prompt

### 🧱 Stage 2: Modify the System Prompt

- [ ] Change the system prompt to a different role (e.g., "You are a helpful data analyst" or "You are a creative writing assistant")
- [ ] Modify the user message to test the new role
- [ ] Run the script again and observe how the agent's behavior changes
- [ ] Try 2-3 different roles to see the impact of system prompts
